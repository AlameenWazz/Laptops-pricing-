Project Title -
Laptops Pricing Project

Description -
This Project is part of the IBM Data Analyst specializatiion. The dataset used is a modified subset that maps the price of laptops with different attributes.
The dataset is a filtered and modified version of the Laptop Price Prediction using specifications dataset, available under the Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0 on the Kaggle website.

Parameters:
The parameters used in the dataset are:
1. Manufacturer The company that manufactured the laptop
2. Category The category to which the laptop belongs: This parameter is mapped to numerical values.
   
The project is divided into 5 sections:

Importing the Dataset:
Imported the dataset from a CSV file to a Pandas dataframe
Develop some basic insights about the dataset

Data Wrangling:
Handling missing data in different ways.
Correcting the data type of different data values as per requirement.
Standardizing and normalizing the appropriate data attributes.
Visualizing the data as grouped bar graph using Binning.
Cnverting a categorical data into numerical indicator variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualiziing individual feature patterns.
Running descriptive statistical analysis on the dataset.
Using groups and pivot tables to find the effect of categorical variables on price.
Using Pearson Correlation to measure the interdependence between variables.

Model Development:
Using Linear Regression in one variable to fit the parameters to a model.
Using Linear Regression in multiple variables to fit the parameters to a model.
Using Polynomial Regression in single variable tofit the parameters to a model.
Creating a pipeline for performing linear regression using multiple features in polynomial scaling.
Evaluating the performance of different forms of regression on basis of MSE and R^2 parameters.

Model Evaluation and Refinement:
Using training, testing and cross validation to improve the performance of the dataset.
Identifying the point of overfitting of a model.
Using Ridge Regression to identify the change in performance of a model based on its hyperparameters.
Using Grid Search to identify the best performing model using different hyperparameters.



INSTALATIO:
Python 3.5 and above
Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotplib, Seaborn.
